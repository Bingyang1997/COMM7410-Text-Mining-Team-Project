# Analysis of Gender Awareness through Primary School Textbooks in Mainland China

## Abstract

This article uses the 2019 new edition of primary school textbooks as research objects to study the construction of gender image in Chinese society and whether it conveys equal social values. We analyzed from the four perspectives: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and illustrations and found that there are certain gender biases in primary school textbooks, but it also shows the cooperative values of the two genders. In addition to the analysis of textbooks, this article also compares with school teaching materials to study whether the compilation of textbooks meets the basic requirements of the school teaching materials. We found that the number of males in textbooks is much higher than that of females. This does not meet the requirements of the Ministry of Education that gender-related content should be evenly distributed.

## Data Source and Methods

Firstly, we decide to pay attention to gender bias in education. Primary school, the beginning of the nine-year compulsory education in mainland China, is crucial for young students to form the gender awareness and is the prior selection for researching. We download all Chinese textbooks from Grade One to Grade Six from the official website and start to pick up words and phrases. We concentrate on verbs, nouns, adjacency, and illustrations, trying to interpret whether there is gender bias from four different aspects. 

According to the principle of classification, we write down and calculate the data by using Microsoft Excel. To better illustrate the data, we make several bar charts, word clouds, and scatter plots to achieve the visualization step. Some words, like verbs, need to be divided by gender and calculated later. Doing data cleaning by Python is an effective way. Then we use Tableau and some free visualization websites to generate different kinds of plots.

As for the researching methods, we use literature research. Before concentrating on our project, we download and browse plenty of related articles on the Internet. In the meanwhile, we analyze how they do they similar research and how they discuss about the gender bias phenomenon. What we read helps us to work out which part we should pay attention to and give examples to design the structure of our project. (Lin Mengyi, 2017)

Besides, we use the method of comparative analysis. We would like to compare the conclusion we draw after analyzing the data with the syllabus published by the official education bureau, trying to figure out whether the materials of the textbooks achieve educating primary school students, as the syllabus says. (Ding Qiuyun, 2017)

Text analysis is also used in our project. We focus on every single word they use. The frequency of verbs, the emotions with the adjacency and the ratio of two genders in illustrations are all included. These content research ways are useful to help us come to a better conclusion. (Wang Juan, 2013) And I would like to introduce the method of image analysis, which also belongs to content analysis. There are plenty of illustrations in the textbooks. Figuring out the number of characters and their occupation ratio in the whole image are two ways to do the analysis. How many pictures contain only males or only females and how are their relationships are essential factors. ( Zong Guoqing, 2017)
